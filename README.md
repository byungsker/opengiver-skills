### toss-frontend-fundamentals

Reviews React and TypeScript frontend code using the source-backed Toss Frontend Fundamentals principles: readability, predictability, cohesion, and coupling. The package includes the mapped source documents instead of only a summary, so the agent can read the relevant original document before reporting a finding.

Claude Code can install it from the marketplace. Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, and OpenClaw can use the shared installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lbo728/opengiver-skills.git
cd opengiver-skills
./plugins/toss-frontend-fundamentals/install.sh --target all
```

Use `--target codex`, `--target claude`, `--target hermes`, or `--target openclaw` for a single agent. See the [plugin README](plugins/toss-frontend-fundamentals/README.md) for destination overrides and backup behavior.
